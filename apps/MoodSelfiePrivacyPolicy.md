## Face Data

For users who use front-facing TrueDepth camera, Mood Selfie uses your face expression to generate emojis. These data include your eyebrows, eyes and mouth movements, for example, frown, open eyes and smile, etc. These data will be saved in your device. If you turn on iCloud Sync & Backup, these data will be safely uploaded to the iCloud server. They will not be shared with any third parties, including the developer.

For users who use devices without TrueDepth camera, Mood Selfie generates emojis automatically. The rules of saving and uploading data are the same as above.

## Changes to this Policy

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will always be at http://ztpala.com/MoodSelfie/PrivacyPolicy. If we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will update http://ztpala.com/MoodSelfie/PrivacyPolicy. By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.

Effective date: April 20, 2019

Privacy Policy

We are committed to protecting the privacy of our users and their personal health information. Our app, which reads health data from Garmin Connect and writes to HealthKit, has been designed with privacy in mind. In this policy, we outline the information we collect, how we use it, and your rights related to your personal health information.

Information Collection and Use

The only information we collect through our app is the health data that you allow us to access from your Garmin Connect account and write to your HealthKit account. This information is used solely for the purpose of providing you with a seamless experience in tracking and managing your health data.

Data Storage and Security

All of the health data that is collected and processed through our app is stored on your device and in your HealthKit account. We do not transfer any data to any third-party servers or share your information with any third parties. Your personal health information is protected through the security measures implemented by Apple in the HealthKit framework.

Your Rights

You have the right to access, review, and control the personal health information that we collect through our app. You can do this by accessing your HealthKit account and adjusting the privacy settings for the app. If you would like to delete the information that we have collected, you can do so by deleting the app from your device and removing it from your HealthKit account.

We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or in response to changes in the law. We will notify you of any changes to this policy by updating the date at the top of this page.

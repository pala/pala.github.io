## Instagram

If you connect Instagram, we access your media & profile info to let you preview your White Border images with other media in your feed. We don't need any write permission.

## Google Firebase

We will also install Google Firebase to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. We collect and use this analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual User.

## Changes to this Policy

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will always be at http://ztpala.com/WhiteBorder/PrivacyPolicy. If we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will update http://ztpala.com/WhiteBorder/PrivacyPolicy. By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.

Effective date: May 5, 2017
